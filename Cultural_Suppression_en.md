# Why Did the Eastern Socialist Revolution Fail? A New Interpretation through the Lens of Cultural Suppression

---

## Abstract

The wave of socialist revolution has temporarily receded, and both the East and the West have fully embraced capitalism. However, under the same capitalist exploitation, Western youth generally show a clear spirit of resistance, while Eastern youth often choose silence and involution.  
This paper proposes: capitalist exploitation is not the decisive factor that leads to the mental repression and rapid abandonment of socialist revolution in Eastern societies. The long-standing cultural suppression is the key obstacle to individual spiritual liberation and the self-sustaining capacity of socialism.  
By comparing the collapse paths of socialism in the Soviet Union and China, this paper further proposes: **without eliminating cultural suppression, the socialist revolution in the East rapidly failed after the death of Mao Zedong.**

## I. Introduction

In the context of highly developed global capitalism, the exploitation of laborers is ubiquitous. However, individuals in different cultural contexts show vastly different responses to oppression.  
This paper begins with the comparison between "Western youth, who generally have the courage to express dissatisfaction directly," and "Eastern youth, who generally choose involution and silence," to propose and elaborate the core thesis: **cultural suppression, as the decisive variable, profoundly shapes individual mental attitudes and the fate of social systems.**

## II. Capitalist Exploitation and Cultural Suppression: The Collusion of Double Oppression

### 2.1 Capitalist Exploitation: Universally Exists, but Not the Decisive Factor

In both East and West, capital controls individual destinies on a global scale:
- Capital infiltrates daily life, and workers generally endure intense exploitation and psychological stress.

However, capitalist exploitation alone cannot explain the enormous differences in individual resistance between East and West.

### 2.2 Cultural Suppression: The Decisive Variable

In addition to capitalist exploitation, Eastern societies have long existed under an invisible disciplinary system that dissolves individual spiritual resistance, namely, **cultural suppression**.

- **Western cultural tradition**: emphasizes individual boundaries, and considers expressing disagreements as legitimate rights. Even in the face of capitalist exploitation, Western youth can naturally raise the "middle finger" to express contempt and protest against hypocrisy and oppression.

- **Eastern cultural tradition**: emphasizes hierarchical order, self-restraint, and suppression. Individual boundaries are systematically weakened, and deeply internalized cultural suppression leads Eastern youth, when facing capitalist exploitation, to habitually choose silence and involution.

Cultural suppression extinguishes individual spiritual resistance, leading people to further self-dissolution under capitalist pressure.

## III. Historical Comparison: Collapse Paths of Socialism in the Soviet Union and China

### 3.1 Soviet Union: Ideological Degeneration, Farewell to Socialist Revolution

- The collapse of Soviet socialism followed a clear path: **ideological degeneration → institutional collapse → farewell to revolution.**
- However, Russian society still retains a certain cultural foundation of resistance, such as the anti-establishment music tradition of Yegor Letov.

### 3.2 China: Ideology Intact, Yet Also Farewell to Socialist Revolution

- Mao Zedong maintained socialist ideology until his later years, with a complete and uncorrupted theoretical system.
- However, cultural suppression was never truly smashed, and the spiritual world of the masses never achieved complete "de-cultural-suppression-ization."
- Once strong leadership was lost, society rapidly evolved into a capitalist society with "socialist characteristics."

Mao Zedong had sharp insight into this — this is exactly why he launched the "Cultural Revolution" rather than a "Revolution Against Theoretical Degeneration."

## IV. Structural Comparison

| Dimension | Western Society | Eastern Society |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Capitalist Exploitation | Affects personal development, even personal survival | Affects personal development, not yet personal survival |
| Cultural Suppression | Weak, channels of expression remain open | Strong, channels of expression are closed |
| Sense of Individual Boundaries | Naturally exists, culture encourages expression | Weakened, culture suppresses individual consciousness |
| Heroic Narrative | Rebels are heroes, resistance is praised | Endurers are heroes, resistance is criticized |
| Spiritual Outlet | Middle finger culture, street culture, satirical arts | Involution, self-blame, spiritual self-consumption |

**Summary:**  
Cultural suppression and capitalist exploitation intertwine in Eastern societies, forming a decisive mechanism of spiritual repression and the destruction of individual resistance.  
Even under heavy capitalist pressure, individuals in Western societies still rely on cultural habits to maintain minimal spiritual outlets.

## V. Conclusion: Why Did the Eastern Socialist Revolution Fail?

The collapse of the Eastern socialist revolution appears to be driven by the wave of capitalism, but the deeper root lies in the long-standing, unbroken cultural suppression.

1. **Capitalist exploitation is widespread, but not the decisive factor in dissolving individual resistance.**
2. **Eastern cultural suppression, as the key variable, blocks the path of individual resistance.**
3. **Western youth, under capitalist exploitation, can still raise the "middle finger" as a symbol of spiritual boundary.**
4. **Eastern youth, under both capitalist exploitation and cultural suppression, fall into self-denial and involution.**
5. **Mao Zedong sharply perceived the threat of cultural suppression to the socialist system and tried to save it through the "Cultural Revolution."**
6. **Cultural suppression of individual resistance is the deep soil for capitalist resurgence. Without breaking cultural suppression, the revolution cannot sustain itself.**
